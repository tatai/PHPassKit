Apple identifiers
=================

When you [create a certificate](certificates.md) to sign your passkits, you choose what Apple calls an identifier for your new Pass Type ID, something that starts with pass. (like pass.domainname.passname). This is your `PassTypeIdentifier`.

After you have successfully created your Pass Type ID, if your try to configure it, you will get an 10-chars alphanumeric uppercase string joined to your `PassTypeIdentifier` like RS5G2O81HQ. This is your `TeamIdentifier`.
