Examples
========

The examples in this folder create passkits using materials from ["Passbook Support Materials"](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=passbook) available in Apple downloads for developers at the [Member Center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action).

To make them work, open config.php and fill all the variables. When you execute each of them, you will get a different Passkit in the output folder yo have set.

* `boardingPass.php` will generate `BoardingPass.pkpass`
* `coupon.php` will generate `Coupon.pkpass`
* `eventTicket.php` will generate `EventTicket.pkpass`
* `generic.php` will generate `Generic.pkpass`
* `storeCard.php` will generate `StoreCard.pkpass`
